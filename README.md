# DTMP – Don’t Touch My Phone 🔒📱

DTMP is a **hackathon MVP Android application** focused on detecting
**unauthorized phone usage after the device is unlocked**
and securely storing evidence using **Google technologies**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Smartphones contain sensitive personal data such as private photos,
messages, and financial apps.  
However, once a phone is unlocked, existing security systems fail to
monitor or log unauthorized access.

Users often never know:
- Who accessed their phone
- When it was accessed
- What actions were performed

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
DTMP introduces **post-unlock security** by monitoring phone activity
after unlock and capturing intrusion evidence.

The system is designed to:
- Identify unauthorized access
- Capture intruder evidence (image + timestamp)
- Store data securely in the cloud
- Provide activity visibility to the owner

---

## 🚀 Key Features (MVP)
- Unauthorized access detection (**simulated in MVP**)
- Intruder image capture
- Timestamp-based activity logging
- Cloud-based evidence storage
- Google API integration
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly architecture

---

## 🧠 Google Technologies Used
- Firebase Authentication (User login)
- Cloud Firestore (Activity logs)
- Google Drive API (Cloud storage for images)
- Google Cloud Console (API management)
- Android Jetpack (App structure)

---

## 🔄 MVP Working Flow
1. User unlocks the phone
2. System checks for unauthorized access (simulated)
3. Intruder image is captured
4. Activity logs are generated
5. Evidence is stored securely in the cloud
